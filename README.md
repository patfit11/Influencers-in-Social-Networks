# Influencers-in-Social-Networks
Kaggle competition circa 2013

Big Data Hackathon

Data Science London and the UK Windows Azure Users Group in partnership with Microsoft and Peerindex, announce the Influencers in Social Networks competition as part of The Big Data Hackathon.  

The dataset, provided by Peerindex, comprises a standard, pair-wise preference learning task. Each datapoint describes two individuals, A and B. For each person, 11 p

The binary label represents a human judgement about which one of the two individuals is more influential. A label '1' means A is more influential than B. 0 means B is more influential than A. The goal of the challenge is to train a machine learning model which, for pairs of individuals, predicts the human judgement on who is more influential with high accuracy. Labels for the dataset have been collected by PeerIndex using an application similar to the one described in this post.
